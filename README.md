# Train_Ticket_Booking_App
The Train Ticket Booking App is a console-based application developed in C that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage train reservations. This mini-project simulates a basic ticket booking system similar to real-world IRCTC services, providing essential features such as ticket booking, cancellation, and booking status checks.
